1)	The Game

Rock paper scissors is a classic 2 players game. Each player chooses rock, paper or scissors. The possible outcomes:
			Rock destroys scissors.
			Scissors cut paper.
			Paper covers rock.
Our code will break the game into 3 phases:
a. User makes a choice
b. Computer makes a choice
c. A compare function will determine who wins


2)	The Frog

A frog only moves forward, but it can move in steps 1 inch long or in jumps 2 inches long. A frog can cover the same distance using different combinations of steps and jumps.
Write a function that calculates the number of different combinations that a frog can use to cover a given distance.
For example, a distance of 3 inches can be covered in three ways: step-step-step, step-jump, and jump-step.


3)	Binary Tree

Write a function that checks if a given binary tree is a valid binary search tree. A binary search tree (BST) is a binary tree where the value of each node is larger or equal to the values in all the nodes
